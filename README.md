## Description
This Code4Earth challenge explores the potential of Diffusion Models for weather prediction, more specificially we test it on the [WeatherBench](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench) benchmark data set.

This repository contains functions to benchmark the diffusion models developed in [diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction). It builds on existing code from [WeatherBench](https://github.com/pangeo-data/WeatherBench).

## Installation
Installation options will be included in the future.

## Roadmap
This repository is part of a [ECMWF Code4Earth Project](https://github.com/ECMWFCode4Earth/diffusion-models-for-weather-prediction), which takes place between May 1 2023 and September 20 2023.

## Installation
- The main repository has two submodules that can be installed as follows:

Clone the main repository.
Clone the `<subodules>` | Make sure you have access to them.

1. `git submodule init`
2. `git submodule update`
