## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://git.ufz.de/cfe23/WeatherDiff.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

- [ ] [Set up project integrations](https://git.ufz.de/cfe23/WeatherDiff/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

- [ ] [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/)
- [ ] [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.html)
- [ ] [Automatically close issues from merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically)
- [ ] [Enable merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/)
- [ ] [Automatically merge when pipeline succeeds](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html)

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.

- [ ] [Get started with GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/quick_start/index.html)
- [ ] [Analyze your code for known vulnerabilities with Static Application Security Testing(SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
- [ ] [Deploy to Kubernetes, Amazon EC2, or Amazon ECS using Auto Deploy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/requirements.html)
- [ ] [Use pull-based deployments for improved Kubernetes management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
- [ ] [Set up protected environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html)

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

### First time installation (On Cluster| Remove later)
TODO
- [ ] Work with latest conda

The conda version installed on EVE is very old (4.8) compare to the latest version (23.0) a major update that happened in betweem and potentially is required is to list the packages installed through pip. Thus at the moment creating a working environment.yaml is infeasible. The solution to this is to add all the packages installed in the environment manually using pip freeze in pip_requirements.txt using command `pip freeze > pip_requirements.txt`

This section will be helpful if we need to rebuild the environment from scratch. Mostly this fixes issues with running CUDA (running ML models on GPU)

- `module load Anaconda3/2020.07`
- `source $EBROOTANACONDA3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`
- `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CONDA_PREFIX/lib${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`
- `conda create -n TORCH311 python=3.11`
- `conda install cudatoolkit=11.7 -c nvidia`
- `conda install -c conda-forge cudnn`
- `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia`

The repository is formatted with black formatter and also uses pre-commit
- Make sure that pre-commit package is installed or `pip install pre-commit`
- pre-commit install to set up the git hook scripts `pre-commit install`

In case you add a package in the environment (via Conda)

You can replace the yaml file with this command `conda env export --from-history | grep -v "^prefix: " > environment.yml`

### Repo cloning

The main repository is WeatherDiff and has a submodule called diffusion-models.

Things to do to make changes to the repository.
- Clone the WeatherDiff
- Clone `submodules` | Make sure you have access to the submodules
    1. `git submodule init` 
    2. `git submodule update`


### Testing if the environment is working (On EVE)
Run test_environment to see if the project is configured successfully. Or run test.sh on eve

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
